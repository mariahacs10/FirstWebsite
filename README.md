# FirstWebsite

Hi my name is Mariah, this is my first half finished website. I plan to add to it and make it better. This is my marker as a 10 year old. 

My older brother told me to start with HTML/CSS and put it on github. He is a computer science student, and is currently going to intern at Uber in 2021. I want to follow in his footsteps, he told me, to do that I need to start.
